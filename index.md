# Alexander J. Fonseca
Hello there! Alexander here. I'm a roboticist by training, and working on a Masters in IC Design, and now doing research into structural batteries. 

Stuff that keep me up in the day:
- Robots, and the design process behind make a robot that's genuinely useful.
- Batteries, and how we can bridge the gap between cutting-edge structural batteries vs the need to implement them industrially.
- Presenting and public speaking for engineers, and the wonderful things that we could have if more engineers had the tools and skills to speak up and be heard.
- What to have for lunch.

Stuff that keep me up at night:
- How to live a good life, and a life worth living. I'm mostly in favor of Stoicism, although I've taken a Buddhist bent of late.
- Thinking clearly, widely and deeply, or at least learning how + trying to do so.
- Dungeons and Dragons with the boys.
- That coffee I had at 4pm, and the caffeine that's still circulating through my veins.
